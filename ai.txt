1. Yes, it's more clever then just picking a random move.
2. I designed an AI that use a white stone to fill every possible intersection and evaluate the whole board to
   get a score and put the stone on the intersection with the highest score. However, it's not so smart.
3. To have a score of the board situation, I calculated the number of some classic stone patterns such as live three,
   sleep three, live two, etc. Each of these patterns have different influence on the whole score.
4. The program now almost can't beat me.
5. To improve the AI, I plan to use minimax algorithum in the future, by adjusting the depth of the tree, the
   difficulty can easily be changed.
